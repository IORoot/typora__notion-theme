# Typora theme - Notion.so

My little attempt at recreating the notion.so theme and functionality through pure CSS themes.

##Â Main feature - Top image full width image

Place an image in the very first paragraph of the page and it will be converted into a full-width, 30vh sized image across the top of the page. 
The image is aligned top-center. and the rest will be cropped. You can change this to be center-center in the CSS.


## Hidden image folder

Put all images in a 'hidden' folder called `.images`at the same directory level as the markdown file by selecting the option for images : 

- ''Copy image to custom folder"

```
./.images/${filename}
```

## Sidebar

- Custom colour.
- Removed folder icons
- Custom SVG Logo Header
- Can add custom SVG backgrounds.


## Codes

Looks like 'Monokai' theme for VSCode.
